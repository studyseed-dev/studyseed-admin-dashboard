// Next.js Link will treat hrefs without a leading slash as relative. If you're on /manage and you use href="create-user", each click navigates to /manage/create-user, then /manage/create-user/create-user, etc.
// By making hrefs absolute (/create-user or /manage/create-user), clicks replace the path properly instead of appending.
